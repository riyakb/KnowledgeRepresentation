"Problem","Possible Cause","Solutions"
"Water leaking","Hoses are not connected correctly.","• Check hoses and connectors for leaks, cracks 
and splits.
 • Check and tighten hose connections."
"","House drain pipes are clogged.","• The washer pumps out water very rapidly. Check 
for water backing up out of the drain pipe during 
drain. If water is seen coming out of the drain, 
check for proper drain hose installation and check 
for restrictions in the drain. Contact a plumber to 
repair drain pipe."
"","Drain hose has come out of drain 
connector or is not inserted far 
enough.","• Tie drain hose to inlet hose or standpipe to 
prevent it from coming out during drain. For 
smaller drain pipes, insert the drain hose into the 
pipe as far as the drain hose flange. For larger 
drain pipes, insert the drain hose into the pipe 1-2 
inches past the flange."
"","Load is too large for the tub.","• Reduce the load or use the Main Washer.
 • Stop the washer and check the load. Make sure 
the load fits loosely in the tub and the lid closes 
easily."
"","Oversudsing of detergent.","• Oversudsing may create leaks, and may be 
caused by the type and amount of detergent 
used. High-Efficiency detergent is the only 
detergent recommended. Always reduce the 
amount of detergent if the load is small or lightly 
soiled, or if the water is very soft. Never use 
more than the maximum amount shown in the 
dispenser provided."
"Water leaks every 
load.","Hoses are not installed correctly.","• Check all fill and drain hose connections to 
ensure that they are tight and secure."
"Excessive sudsing","Too much detergent or incorrect 
detergent.","• HE detergents are formulated specifically for 
High-Efficiency washers and contain suds-
reducing agents. Only use detergent with the 
High-Efficiency (HE) logo.
 • For detergent quantities refer to the Detergent 
Use section. If sudsing or detergent residue 
continue to be an issue, add an Extra Rinse."
"Washer will not turn 
on.","Power cord is not properly plugged 
in.","• Make sure that the plug is plugged securely into a 
grounded, 3-prong, 120-VAC, 60 Hz outlet."
"","House fuse is blown, circuit breaker 
has tripped, or power outage has 
occurred.","• Reset circuit breaker or replace fuse. Do not 
increase fuse capacity. If the problem is a 
circuit overload, have it corrected by a qualified 
electrician."
