"Problem","Possible Cause","Solutions"
"Wash cycle time is 
longer than usual.","The washer automatically adjusts 
the wash time for the amount of 
laundry, water pressure and other 
operating conditions.","• This is normal. The washer adjusts cycle time 
automatically to provide optimal results for the 
selected cycle. The time remaining shown in the 
display is only an estimate. Actual time may vary."
"Incomplete or 
no dispensing of 
detergent","Too much detergent used.","• Make sure to measure detergent using the 
provided dispenser. Use only HE (High-
Efficiency) detergent.
 • NOTE
 • Always use as little detergent as possible. High-
Efficiency washers need very little detergent 
to achieve optimum results. Using too much 
detergent will cause poor wash and rinse 
performance and may contribute to odors in 
washer."
"","Insufficient water supply.","• Make sure that both hot and cold water faucets 
are turned on all the way."
"Washer will not 
operate.","Control panel has powered off due 
to inactivity.","• This is normal. Press the Power button to turn 
the washer on."
"","Washer is unplugged.","• Make sure cord is plugged securely into a 
working outlet."
"","Water supply is turned off.","• Turn both hot and cold faucets fully on."
"","Controls are not set properly.","• Make sure the cycle was set correctly, close the 
lid and drawer and press the Start/Pause button."
"","Lid or drawer is open.","• The washer will not operate if the lid or drawer is 
open. Close the lid or drawer and make sure that 
nothing is caught under the lid preventing it from 
closing completely. Make sure the drawer is fully 
closed."
"","Circuit breaker/fuse is tripped/ 
blown.","• Check house circuit breakers/fuses. Replace 
fuses or reset breaker. The washer should be 
on a dedicated branch circuit. The washer will 
resume the cycle where it stopped once power is 
restored."
"","Control needs to be reset.","• Press the Power button, then re-select the 
desired cycle and press the Start/Pause button."
"","Start/Pause was not pressed after a 
cycle was set.","• Press the Power button then re-select the 
desired cycle and press the Start/Pause button. 
The washer will shut off if the Start/Pause button 
is not pressed within 4 minutes."
"","Extremely low water pressure.","• Check another faucet in the house to make sure 
that household water pressure is adequate."
"","Washer is too cold.","• If the washer has been exposed to temperatures 
below freezing for an extended period of time, 
allow it to warm up before pressing the Power 
button. Otherwise, the display will not come on."
